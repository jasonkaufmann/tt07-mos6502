# Tiny MOS6502
## Multiplex Data and Address Lines
Currently, TinyTapeout only supports 8 inputs, 8 outputs, and 8I/Os (input/outputs). This is a total of 24 pins. The 6502 has 40 pins. To make this work we have to mux some stuff.

The ADDRESS lines are almost always an output to a memory location, so lets use the 8 output pins to represent this 16 bit binary number. The best technique for the address multiplexing is probably to send the first 8 bits of the address on one clock cyle and then send the top 8 on the next cycle.
So, to control the address lines of this we will have a very basic circuit on the output that takes the 16 bit address and splits it into two 8 bit accesses. There are 2 other output signals R/W and SYNC, so we will need 3 total reads/clock cycles to get all the address lines and other output signals out of the CPU. So, the 6502 internal clock will run 3x slower than the external one you provide in the board.

The 8 DATA pins will go on the  I/O lines unmuxed and should fit perfectly. They need to be bidirectional for reads and writes to memory / other peripherals.

The rest of the pins RDY, IRQ, NMI, and SO are inputs are can go on the input pins.

This results in the final TT pinout as follows:

# Tiny Tapeout Verilog Project Template

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).
